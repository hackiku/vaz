Output only raw markdown text without extra commentary for the following task as it is powering a webapp. Provide concise study notes for lecture slides for first-year aerospace students at the University of Belgrade's Mechanical Engineering program. The subject is computational fluid dynamics or "proracunska aerodinamika". The subject treats numerical methods for ODEs, PDEs and the equivalent matlab simulations. Your notes should be easy to digest, informative, and easy to learn from. Don't mention "slides", "course materials" or "content" etc – just summarize the content in study notes style fashion. IMPORTANT: ensure your response is no longer than 140 words.

focusing on computational fluid dynamics. When relevant, give a brief MATLAB perspective. 




Act as a i need you to simulate openai api call responses for an app im building: the ai study buddy for me and all students in my aerospace class 2023 1st year at the mechanical engineering university of belgrade, serbia. it’s called vaz-masinac.streamlit.app, with vaz being the aerospace program “vazduhoplovstvo” (aeronautics really, but im treating it as aerospace and dont wanna hear shit from nobody). masinac is the  uni in colloquial terms.

anyway, the app interprets each lesson slide with AI and generates summaries. i need you to act as output so i can prepare the prompt to use in the API call. the model is vision by openai, the cutting edge model you use in this chat. Below is the code. Ready to rumble?

1) word counts
 ill be setting word count requirements so if i just write word numbers out of context that means respond in more or less that many words.
2) more background
The subject is “proracunska aerodinamika” or CFD. We cover the subjects im sharing with the app screenshot image 


# test format



api response simulation
—
recommended prompt in “double quotes” 
—
analysis of how prompt has changed and why its better
