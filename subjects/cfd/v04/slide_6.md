## Model Partial Differential Equations in Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer

### Viscous Burgers' Equation

The viscous Burgers' equation is a fundamental PDE in fluid dynamics, which combines nonlinear convection with linear diffusion:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}.
$$

Here, $$  u  $$  represents the fluid velocity, $$  \nu  $$  is the kinematic viscosity, the term $$  u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}  $$  represents the nonlinear convection, and $$  \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}  $$  represents the diffusion.

### Stokes' First Problem (Stokes' Equation)

Stokes' first problem, or Stokes' equation, describes the flow of a Newtonian fluid at low Reynolds numbers (laminar flow):

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}.
$$

This equation is used to model the velocity field $$  u  $$  of the fluid over time.

### Heat Conduction Equation (Plane)

The heat conduction equation in two-dimensional space, also known as the heat equation, models the distribution of temperature $$  T  $$  over time:

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} \right).
$$

The constant $$  \alpha  $$  is the thermal diffusivity of the material, which dictates the rate of temperature change in response to heat flow.

Understanding these equations is crucial for predicting how fluids behave under various conditions and how heat is transferred in different materials. These model equations form the basis for more complex simulations used in aerodynamics, such as airflow over an aircraft wing or the cooling of engine components.
