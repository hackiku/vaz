## Visual Representation of PDE Solution

The solution to the PDE, $$ u(x, t) = e^{-(x-2t)^2} $$ , can be visualized graphically, which aids in understanding its behavior over space and time:

- The **3D plot** shows how the solution, represented by the vertical axis, evolves. The peak of the solution moves in the direction of increasing $$ x $$  as $$ t $$  increases, maintaining its shape. This movement is consistent with the characteristic lines of the PDE, indicating that the solution is not dispersing or spreading out as it propagates.

- The **contour plot** provides a different perspective by showing lines of constant solution value in the $$ x-t $$  plane. These lines are diagonal, highlighting the characteristics $$ x = 2t + x_0 $$ , which confirms that the solution translates to the right over time without changing shape.

### Insights from the Plots

- **Characteristics Visualization**: Both plots illustrate that the characteristics are straight lines in the $$ x-t $$  plane, a reflection of the constant wave speed in the linear PDE.

- **Invariant Solution Profile**: The shape of the solution profile doesn't change, indicating that the initial conditions simply translate without distortion, a hallmark of linear hyperbolic PDEs.

### Significance in Aerodynamics

In aerodynamics, such behavior might represent the undistorted propagation of a pressure wave in an idealized fluid, illustrating concepts like wave speed and the influence of initial conditions on the flow field.
