#### Introduction to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are equations involving partial derivatives of a function of several variables. In aerodynamics, this function often represents physical quantities such as temperature, pressure, or velocity fields.

### First-Order PDEs

For two independent variables, a first-order PDE can be written as:

$$
a \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + b \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + cu = d.
$$

Here, $$  u  $$  is the unknown function of the independent variables $$  t  $$  (time) and $$  x  $$  (space), and $$  a  $$ , $$  b  $$ , $$  c  $$ , $$  d  $$  are coefficients that can also be functions of $$  t  $$  and $$  x  $$ .

### General Form of PDEs

The general form of a PDE for a function $$  u  $$  of $$  n  $$  variables is:

$$
\Phi \left( x_1, ..., x_n; u; \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}, ..., \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_n}; \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}; ... ; \frac{\partial^m u}{\partial x_i ... \partial x_j} \right) = 0, \quad i, j \in [1, n].
$$

This equation states that $$ \Phi $$, a function of the unknown $$ u $$, its first derivatives, its second derivatives, up to its $$ m $$-th derivatives, equals zero.

### Application of PDEs

PDEs have vast applications in describing the behavior of various processes across mechanics, thermodynamics, electrodynamics, fluid mechanics, and elasticity. In aerodynamics, they are used to model the flow of air over bodies, taking into account factors like pressure distribution and airflow velocity.

Understanding the solution to these PDEs helps predict how aircraft will perform under different conditions, and is crucial for designing efficient and safe aircraft structures.
