#### Example 2 - Formulation and Initial Condition

**Task:**

Solve the PDE:
$$  2txu_x + u_t = u  $$ , with the domain being all real numbers for $$  x  $$  and $$  t > 0  $$ .

**Initial Condition:**
$$  u(x,0) = x  $$ , which applies to all real numbers for $$  x  $$ .

This PDE is a first-order linear non-homogeneous equation with variable coefficients. The initial condition sets up a linear relationship between the solution $$  u  $$  and the spatial variable $$  x  $$  at $$  t = 0  $$ . This problem is typically approached with the method of characteristics, where solutions are found along curves in the $$  x-t  $$  plane that are determined by the PDE itself. The solution will provide insights into how the value of $$  u  $$  evolves over time from this linear starting point.
