#### Classification of Partial Differential Equations

PDEs can be classified based on the linearity of terms involving the unknown function $$  u  $$  and its derivatives:

### Linear PDEs

Linear PDEs contain the unknown function $$  u  $$  and its derivatives to the first power only and do not contain products of $$  u  $$  and its derivatives. An example of a linear PDE is the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + a \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0,
$$

where $$  a  $$  is a constant.

### Quasilinear PDEs

Quasilinear PDEs are linear in the highest derivatives of $$  u  $$ . The coefficients of these derivatives can be functions of $$  u  $$  itself but not of its derivatives.

### Nonlinear PDEs

Nonlinear PDEs contain terms that involve products or nonlinear functions of the unknown function and its derivatives. An example is the inviscid Burgers' equation, which is a fundamental equation in fluid dynamics describing shock waves and turbulence:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0.
$$

### Importance in Aerodynamics

The solutions to linear PDEs are typically easier to find and can be superimposed due to the principle of superposition. However, most realistic aerodynamic problems involve nonlinear PDEs, where the principle of superposition does not apply, and the solutions are more complex and sensitive to initial conditions.

Understanding the nature of these equations is crucial for applying the correct methods to solve aerodynamic problems, such as predicting airflow around wings and calculating lift and drag forces.
