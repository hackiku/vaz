#### Lecture Content Overview

### Introduction to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
Understanding the mathematical foundations of fluid dynamics, which are often modeled by PDEs. This section would cover the basics of PDEs and their relevance to aerodynamics.

### Model PDEs
Exploring standard PDEs used in aerodynamics, such as the potential flow equation, Euler equations, and Navier-Stokes equations, which describe different flow regimes and assumptions.

### Analytical Solutions to First-Order PDEs
Discussing methods for solving first-order PDEs analytically, which is possible for simpler flow problems. This could include characteristics methods or separation of variables.

#### Example 1: Linear Wave Equation
The linear wave equation represents a fundamental PDE in aerodynamics and acoustics, describing how wave fronts move in space and time.

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

Where $$  c  $$  is the wave speed, and $$  u  $$  is the wave function.

### Examples 2 and 3
Further application examples of the concepts discussed, likely involving more complex scenarios or different types of PDEs.

### Example 4: Setting Boundary Conditions
Demonstrating how to apply boundary conditions to PDEs, an essential step for any realistic aerodynamics simulation.

### Exercises 5, 6, 7
Practical exercises to reinforce the concepts learned, likely involving problem-solving and application of numerical methods.

### Second-Order PDE Classification
Introduction to the classification of second-order PDEs (elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic), which is crucial for selecting appropriate solution methods.
