## Finding Characteristic Curves

The method of characteristics transforms a partial differential equation (PDE) into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are easier to solve. The characteristic curves are the paths in the solution space along which the PDE reduces to an ODE.

### Transformation Equations

Given a PDE, we find transformations for $$ x $$ , $$ t $$ , and $$ u $$  as functions of a new variable $$ r $$ :

$$
\frac{d x}{d r} = a(x, t, u), \quad \frac{d t}{d r} = b(x, t, u), \quad \frac{d u}{d r} = c(x, t, u).
$$

### Transformed PDE

These transformations convert the original PDE into a more tractable form:

$$
a(x, t, u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + b(x, t, u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{dx}{dr} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{dt}{dr} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{d u}{d r} = c(x, t, u).
$$

### Solution Method

If a corresponding transformation from $$ (x, t) $$  to new coordinates $$ (r, s) $$  exists, we then solve the simpler ODE:

$$
\frac{d u}{d r} = c.
$$

After solving this ODE, we perform an inverse transformation from $$ (r, s) $$  back to $$ (x, t) $$  to find the solution $$ u(x, t) $$ .

The process involves integrating along the characteristics, which are the curves in the $$ x-t $$  plane determined by the ODEs derived from the original PDE. This approach is particularly useful in solving hyperbolic PDEs, such as those that arise in wave propagation, fluid dynamics, and other fields where the propagation of information or physical quantities is involved.
